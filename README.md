**Laravel 254 Share Book**
======================

This book is a collection of code snippets, projects and articles written and done by the Laravel community based in Kenya. Discussions on the book are stored using [Lara254 Disqus](https://lara254.disqus.com).
Book Format
-------------
The book will mainly hold pages with content that displays functional code use that is applicable in the Laravel. Readers will have the ability to comment on pages and get the writers feedback. Discussions on individual pages will help in further understanding the code available in the page. Also will help writers get useful feedback that can help improve the code further.

Another important feature other than code snippets, members of the community will be able to share links to open source projects they are doing. With a simple share, having the link to the repository and include the README file for the project. The community is able to learn from each other and offer support (e.g code contributions) to such projects. Apart from sharing open source projects users can also share website links to projects they have worked on. (Ensure you have the copy rights to say you have worked on it). This helps new members of the community see the end products of Laravel projects and be able to interact with them.

The book also gives writers the ability to write articles with various technical related topics. You are advised that articles should be technically oriented and have a touch of Laravel for easy acceptance as material worth to be in the book.

Please note the format of the book will change as it grows or by popular demand from the community.
